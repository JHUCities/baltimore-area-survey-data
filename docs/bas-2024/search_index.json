The BAS develops data that support community needs and scientific research in the Baltimore area. The program seeks to survey a sample of residents annually to allow for timely data on conditions experienced by Baltimore-area residents. Researchers at 21CC and the Community Collaborators Committee (CCC) identify topics in need of investigation to understand the city, its surroundings, and its people. The CCC comprises leaders from community organizations, nonprofits, businesses, and government office. The CCC works with faculty and graduate students to investigate the topics to identify the topics identified through the survey data collected. 1.3 Themes and Objectives This survey follows the BAS 2023, and it repeats some questions while also adding new content. The BAS 2024 focused on four themes: Neighborhoods questions about resident perceptions of neighborhoods and conditions in residents’ own neighborhoods Governance questions about how much residents trust local, state, and federal government as well as satisfaction with various government services Transportation questions about whether and how residents access transportation as well as a focus on Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Health &amp; Well-Being questions about health conditions and experiences with violence Since 2024 was the 70th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision at the Supreme Court, the survey asked a series of questions about school integration and school policies. Finally, a module asked residents about how the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in March 2024 affected their lives and perceptions about government efforts to support residents and to rebuild. 1.4 Key Personnel 1.4.1 21st Century City Personnel Michael D.

The first component was a stratified random sample of 10,000 addresses with oversamples of addresses in Baltimore City and in neighborhoods with disproportionately large shares of Black or Hispanic residents. The sampling plan for this component closely followed the BAS 2023 sampling plan. The second component was an additional sample of 1,500 addresses that augmented the first component.1 These 1,512 addresses were all located in one of the 55 census tracts that include the route proposed for the Red Line mass transit project that traverses Baltimore from east to west. 2.2.1 Stratification The 10,000 addresses in the first component were sampled from two major strata defined by jurisdiction with 6,000 addresses in Baltimore City and 4,000 addresses in Baltimore County. Substrata were defined based on: Public Use Microdata Area regions (five in Baltimore City and seven in Baltimore County) Community Statistical Areas defined by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (in Baltimore City only) Black/Hispanic strata based on Census tract shares of Black and Hispanic residents The Black/Hispanic strata are based on the combined share of Blacks and Hispanics for the Census Tract using data from the 2017-2021 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. The following six classifications for strata of were used for the combined share of Black and Hispanic residents: \\(\\leq\\) 10% Black or Hispanic \\(&gt;\\) 10% to \\(\\leq\\) 25% Black or Hispanic \\(&gt;\\) 25% to \\(\\leq\\) 50% Black or Hispanic \\(&gt;\\) 50% to \\(\\leq\\) 75% Black or Hispanic \\(&gt;\\) 75% to \\(\\leq\\) 90% Black or Hispanic \\(&gt;\\) 90% Black or Hispanic 2.2.2 Oversample Census tracts were over-sampled based on jurisdiction. In Baltimore County, addresses were over-sampled such that the ratio of sampled addresses in the highest-Black/Hispanic stratum was 1.62 times that of the lowest stratum. In Baltimore City, the addresses were over-sampled such that the ratio of sampled addresses in the highest-Black/Hispanic stratum was 1.27 times that of the lowest stratum. Tables 2.1 and 2.2 provide the relative sampling rates of different strata within each jurisdiction (totals may not sum to 100 due to rounding).

The rate of sampling relative to the baseline design was 1.95 times the baseline rate for tracts in the Red Line Corridor. Crossing strata for oversamples of racial/ethnic categories with presence in the Red Line resulted in 21 strata. 2.2.4 Final Design The final design yielded 11,506 addresses in the sample, 7,337 in Baltimore City and 4,169 in Baltimore County. There were 3,092 sampled addresses in the Red Line corridor and 8,415 not in the Red Line corridor. The final household probability of being sampled ranged from 1.00% to 5.13% across the 21 strata. A list of sampling strata and sample probabilities are reported in Table 4.1. Westat implicitly stratified ABS frame into 145 substrata to ensure geographic representation: 33 substrata in Baltimore County and 112 substrata in Baltimore City. The 33 cells in Baltimore county are all possible minority strata within the 7 PUMA regions (note that each PUMA region does not have every minority stratum represented within it). The 112 cells in Baltimore represent 56 community statistical areas (CSAs), sometimes divided across PUMA region, and then all represented minority strata within the CSAs. For more detailed information about the sample design, including lists of all substrata, refer to Baltimore Area Survey Methods Report (Popick and Rizzo, 2024). 2.3 Data Collection The 2024 BAS used a “push-to-web” mode that allowed respondents to conduct a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). A paper version was offered as well. One survey experiments were used and described in more detail below. 2.3.1 Field period The field period for this survey was from September 23 through November 12, 2024. 2.3.2 Mailings Sampled addresses received up to four letters inviting them to participate in the Baltimore Area Survey. Each mailing mentioned a promised $5 incentive for completing the survey. The contents of each mailing are described below. All mailings were sent by first class USPS mail. All undeliverable mail and completed surveys were returned to Westat and documented in the sample file. Mailing schedule and contents: Mailing 1, sent September 23, 2024 to all sampled addresses #10 envelope with logo of either a Baltimore Area Survey logo or a Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative logo (determined by randomization, see Section 2.4 for more information) One page cover letter including survey website and unique login credentials, with FAQ on reverse $2 bill tucked inside the letter Mailing 2, sent September 30, 2024 to all sampled addresses Folded postcard with either a Baltimore Area Survey logo or a Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative logo Content included survey website and unique login credentials Mailing 3, sent October 16, 2024 to addresses that previous mailings had not been turned as undeliverable and that had not completed survey #10 envelope with either a Baltimore Area Survey logo, or a Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative logo One page cover letter including survey website and unique login credentials, with FAQ on reverse Mailing 4, sent October 29, 2024 to addresses that previous mailings had not been turned as undeliverable and that had not completed survey #10 envelope with either a Baltimore Area Survey logo, or a Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative logo One page cover letter including survey website and unique login credentials, with FAQ on reverse If a respondent requested a paper survey, the respondent was sent: 9x12 inch envelope with Baltimore Area Survey logo One page cover letter including instructions for returning paper survey as well as survey website and unique login credentials, with FAQ on reverse Survey booklet, 20 pages 8.75x11.5 inch postage-paid return envelope with the Baltimore Area Survey logo Thank-you mailings were sent to respondents who completed the survey who requested cash rather than an Amazon.com gift card. 2.3.3 Computer-Assisted Personal Interview Respondents who chose to complete the BAS via a web survey were directed to an individualized URL with the hosted at https://www.BaltimoreAreaSurvey.org. The individualized URL pointed to a site with the questionnaire designed using SurveyBuilder, Westat’s proprietary software administration software. 2.3.4 Survey Variations Random assignment was used to adjust the survey in six locations: Climate concern fill pattern (bas24_svy_clmcond); the value for a respondent was assigned randomly to either 1 or 2. The value determined the text used to fill the {{CLMCOND}} fill in the question bas24_clm_worry. If the value equaled 1, {{CLMCOND}} was filled with the text “your personal well-being?” If the value equaled 2, {{CLMCOND}} was filled with the text “the well-being of your loved ones?” Key Bridge Collapse question split ballot (bas_svy_kbsplit); the value for a respondent was assigned randomly to either 1 or 2. The value determined which subset of questions the respondent was asked about the Key Bridge Collapse. If the value equaled 1, respondents were asked about confidence in the response of governments to addressing the Key Bridge (bas24_con_kbconfl, bas24_con_kbconfs, bas24_con_kbconff, and bas24_con_kbdate1) If the value equaled 2, respondents were asked to rate the job of governments in addressing the Key Bridge collapse (bas24_con_kbhelpl, bas24_con_kbhelps, bas24_con_kbhelpf, and bas24_con_kbdate2) Complete Streets fill pattern (bas24_svy_cstcond); the value for a respondent was assigned randomly to either 1 or 2. The value determined the text used to fill the {{COMPSTRTXT}} text in questions about safe streets policy (bas24_tsp_cstknow, bas24_tsp_cstfo, and bas24_tsp_cstfoa). The introductory text to the questions were also varied to match. -If the value equaled 1, {{COMPSTRTXT}} was filled with the text “Complete Streets Policy” -If the value equaled 2, {{COMPSTRTXT}} was filled with the text “policy like this” Question order for school integration questions (bas24_svy_schinto); the value for a respondent was assigned randomly to either 1 or 2. If the value equaled 1, bas24_att_schintb was asked before bas24_att_schintw If the value equaled 2, bas24_att_schintw was asked before bas24_att_schintb Question order for school policy questions (bas24_svy_schpolo); the value for a respondent was assigned randomly to either 1 or 2. If the value equaled 1, bas24_att_schrspnd was asked before bas24_att_schrmv If the value equaled 2, bas24_att_schrmv was asked before bas24_att_schrspnd Response order for limited government question (bas24_att_lmtgov); the value for a respondent was assigned randomly to either 1 or 2 If the value equaled 1, the response options were presented with “Much more” listed first If the value equaled 2, the response options were presented with “Much less” listed first 2.3.5 Pen-and-Paper Personal Interview The pen-and-paper version of the survey did not allow randomization and skip patterns. Data from respondents who requested and returned a paper copy of the survey were entered through the survey website by Westat project staff. Randomization could not be executed with the paper-and-pencil interview. Therefore all six survey variations described in Section 2.3.4 were set to equal “1” in the paper-and-pencil version. Because instructions cannot be enforced on paper surveys as on the web instrument, the following rules were needed in order to enter the paper survey. Entered the survey from beginning to end, with the web programming enforcing skips. This means that if respondents answered a later question that they should not have because of a skip, their answer was not recorded. The exception to this was the income questions: if the respondent filled the detailed income question, then the corresponding value for above or below $70,000 was entered and the detailed value was entered. Recorded the less extreme response if there were multiple responses to a “select-one” question, or the mark was between two response options. If the question included an “Other-specify” option and the “specify” option was filled, that option took precedence. If there was a provided response as well as written commentary, recorded the selected response and ignored the commentary. If no response was selected, none was recorded based on the commentary. If the respondent scratched out a selected response, that response was considered empty, whether or not they provided an alternate response. If the person wrote “zero” for number of adults in the household, this was submitted as “1” If more than one employment status was selected, “Retired” took precedence over other responses 2.3.6 Respondent Incentives All respondents were given a $2 bill as a pre-incentive and a $5 after completing the survey via an Amazon.com electronic gift card or, if requested, cash. 2.4 Survey Field Experiment Households were selected to receive mailings with either the Baltimore Area Survey logo or the Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative logo (see Figure 2.1). The assignment to the BAS logo or 21CC logo was made with addresses arranged in a geographical sort so that the two conditions were distributed evenly across all geographic areas. The assigned logo was included on both the envelope and the letter. Households were assigned to receive the same logo for all mailings throughout the field period. The website had a single landing page that displayed both logos. Figure 2.1: BAS and 21CC/JHU Logos used on mailings There were 696 completed surveys from those receiving the Baltimore Area Survey logo, and 796 completed surveys from those receiving the Johns Hopkins 21st Century Cities Initiative logo. 2.5 Response Rate The response rate for this study was calculated using AAPOR’s RR3 formula. The overall sample response rate was 19.9 percent. Table 2.3 shows each category of the calculation in detail for the overall sample as well as experimental and geographical groups of interest. Completed surveys were those that finished the final substantive question (i.e., they may not have provided contact information for future follow-up). All other surveys were considered break-offs. The variable \\(e\\) is calculated as the proportion of eligible interviews (i.e., the sum of categories 1 and 2) divided by the sum of eligible and not eligible addresses.2 Table 2.3: AAPOR Response Rate 3 calculations for groups of interest CategoryDispositionFull sampleBAS logoJHU 21CC logoCityCounty Total sample used11,5125,7565,7567,3504,162 Interview (Category 1) - I1.1 Complete1,492696796934558 Eligible, non-interview (Category 2) - R2.1 Refusal &amp; Breakoff289162177226113 Unknown eligibility, non-interview (Category 3) – UH3.19 Nothing ever returned8,7454,4164,3295,4733,272 Not eligible (Category 4)4.30 Housing Unit Ineligible936482454717219 e0.660.640.680.620.75 AAPOR RR319.918.920.320.617.8 2.6 Weighting Weights were applied to ensure representation of adults in the Baltimore area. Three components were used to create sample weights to represent the population: base weights to account for unequal probability of selection, nonresponse adjustment to adjust for differential nonresponse, and calibration to ensure representation to population-level control values. 2.6.1 Base Weights The ABS address probability of selection arises from the stratification structure determined by the Census Tract of the address. The household-level base weight is the inverse of this sampling-rate stratum probability from the 21 sampling strata described in Section 2.2.4. One adult was sampled from each sampled household. Within household sampling is based on the next-birthday method. The invitation letter requested that the adult with the next birthday respond to the survey. We treat this pseudo-random selection as equivalent to a random sampling, so the probability of selection of the final respondent adult within the household is based on the adults in the household. This information is collected as part of the questionnaire, variable bas24_dem_adults. The within-household base weight component is therefore bas24_dem_adults itself (e.g., if there are three adults in the household, then the sampling probability is 1 in 3, so that the base weight is 3). If bas24_dem_adults is missing on an otherwise completed questionnaire, it was imputed (see Section 2.6.4 below). 2.6.2 Non-Response Adjustments Non-response adjustments were made based on age, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, gender, and geography. Sampling strata were used for the basis of non-response adjustment. In Baltimore County, the 34 sampling strata were based on oversample stratum (listed in Table 2.1) and Red Line status. In Baltimore City, the 120 sampling strata were based on Red Line status crossed with Community Statistical Area, crossed with Black/Hispanic stratum (listed in Table 2.2). Cells with fewer than 10 respondents were collapsed across Black/Hispanic strata, then by Red Line status, and then by geography if necessary. Collapsing led to 43 response cells with response adjustments ranging from a low of 1.0 to a high of 1.6. 2.6.3 Calibration Adjustments Weights were then calibrated to match control totals from the ACS Public Use Microdata Set (PUMS) so that these control totals are based on samples from the U.S. population within ‘PUMS regions’. The calibration adjusts both for nonresponse (beyond the adjustments in Section 2.6.2), and for undercoverage of the ABS frame as a representation of all adults. Weights were calibrated using raking (iterative proportional fitting, or IPF) to rake the nonresponse-adjusted weights (the base weights after non-response adjustments as specified in Section 2.6.2) to control totals in the following dimensions separated by jurisdiction: PUMS region within county Gender within each county (male and female; note that ACS only has control totals for male and female, so transgender and other gender from the questionnaire were collapsed for this calibration step) Race/ethnicity within county: Hispanic or non-Hispanic Other Race Non-Hispanic Black Only Non-Hispanic White Only Non-Hispanic Asian Only Age within county 18 to 34 35 to 54 55 to 69 70 or older Education level within county No high-school diploma or high-school diploma only 2-year associates degree only or 4-year college diploma only Professional degree Home-owners vs. renters within county Excessive weights were trimmed. Westat’s RAKE-TRIM algorithm was used for raking and trimming weights. Westat applied the algorithm to trim back weights that fell outside a given range, and then re-raked to the control totals, in an iterative raking and trimming process until the control totals were achieved while at same time the weights are also within certain constraints. When convergence did not occur, control cells were collapsed to reduce constraints until the algorithm converged. In order to achieve convergence, we needed to collapse the three education level cells into two cells for Baltimore County only (not Baltimore City, where all three cells were maintained). The final two education cells for Baltimore County were no professional degree vs. professional degree (collapsing the two lower-education-achievement cells). No other collapsing was necessary. Prior to collapsing cells, the trimming constraint was adjusted. To preserve the unbiasedness of the weights, trimming cells within which constraints were applied were the 12 sampling-rate strata listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Within these 12 sampling-rate strata, weights 3.5 times the median weight were trimmed to 3.5 and weights smaller than 1/3.5 times the median weight were trimmed to 1/3.5. The values were changed to 4.5 and 1/4.5 when convergence could not be achieved. There were a total of 14 trimming cells based on county, sampling stratum, and number of adults in the household. The final rake-trim algorithm allowed some slightly higher ratios than 3.5 within the final trimming cells to facilitate convergence of the algorithm. The maximum ratio between trimming cell maximum weight and the cell median weight was 3.553. The minimum ratio between trimming cell minimum weight and the cell median weight was 1/3.587. 2.6.4 Imputations The weighting steps described in Sections 2.6.1-2.6.3 above required responses for the following variables from all respondents: Number of adults in household (bas24_dem_adults) Gender (bas24_dem_gender)3 Age group (18 to 34, 35 to 54, 55 to 69, 70 and over; derived from bas24_dem_yearborn) Education (No HS degree or HS degree without associates or bachelors degree, associates degree or bachelors degree only; master’s, doctorate, and professional Degree; derived from bas24_dem_edattain) Race (Asian-American Only, Black Only, White Only, Other; derived from responses to race questions bas24_dem_race*) Ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic; bas24_dem_latx) Housing tenure (homeowner vs. renter; derived from bas24_dem_own) When values for variables missed for fewer than five (5) respondents, the value was imputed to be the modal response category for the derived variable. In other cases, imputations were calculated using the R program mice (multiple imputations chained equations). The mice algorithm was applied using predictive models for each variable calculated based on all others in addition to Census tract information (Black/Hispanic percentage) and then iterated through the individual-variable chained equations one-by-one to convergence. Models were estimated separately for each jurisdiction. The final implementation of the sample plan resulted in 1,512 addresses in the Red Line corridor to reach desired sample in individual strata.↩︎ See Section 4.2 in the Appendix for response rates calculated to be comparable to the BAS 2023.↩︎ Values other than “male” or “female” for bas24_dem_gender were imputed for weighting purposes because the American Community Survey includes no responses other than “male” and “female”.↩︎ "],["codebook.html", "3 Codebook 3.1 Neighborhoods 3.2 Connectivity 3.3 Health 3.4 Transportation 3.5 Attitudes &amp; Opinions 3.6 Demographic Information 3.7 Survey Information", " 3 Codebook 3.1 Neighborhoods YEARS IN NEIGHBORHOOD Variable name: nhd_nyrs Question: How many years have you lived in your current neighborhood?
